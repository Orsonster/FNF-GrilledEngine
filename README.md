# Friday Night Funkin' - Grilled Engine
Modified version of Psych engine

## Installation:

Refer to [the Build Instructions](./BUILDING.md)

## Customization:

if you wish to disable things like *Lua Scripts* or *Video Cutscenes*, you can read over to `Project.xml`

inside `Project.xml`, you will find several variables to customize Psych Engine to your liking

to start you off, disabling Videos should be simple, simply Delete the line `"VIDEOS_ALLOWED"` or comment it out by wrapping the line in XML-like comments, like this `<!-- YOUR_LINE_HERE -->`

same goes for *Lua Scripts*, comment out or delete the line with `LUA_ALLOWED`, this and other customization options are all available within the `Project.xml` file

## Extra:
* This is not an original engine, Shadow Mario is responsible for 99% of the code within this engine, this is just
a fun little project I decided to work on, and this should work identically to psych

## Credits:
* Shadow Mario - Programmer
* Riveren - Artist

### Special Thanks
